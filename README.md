I was following a tutorial, I'm not sure where the original went, but is probably based off of this repo: https://github.com/Luchkata/Algorithmic_Trading_Machine_Learning

I wrote a backtest to verify this guys claim: https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1cwsco8/a_mean_reversion_strategy_with_211_sharpe/
